## Windows Setup Note

The `10-web-and-database/databases` and `14-application-architecture/enterprise-capstone` sections depend on `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` which requires CGO and a C compiler. On Windows without WSL:

1. Install [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) or [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
2. Ensure `gcc` is in your PATH: `gcc --version`
3. Set `CGO_ENABLED=1` in your environment

Alternatively, use WSL2 (recommended). All other sections work on Windows without a C compiler.
