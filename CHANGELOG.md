All notable changes to The Go Engineer are documented here.

Format: **[Date] - Description**. Sections: `Added`, `Fixed`, `Changed`, `Removed`.

---

## [2026-04-23] - v2.1.0-rc.1 Published

### Added

- Published the `v2.1.0-rc.1` prerelease from `release/v2`.
- Opened the public RC validation window with a release page and maintainer announcement.

### Changed

- Updated the public release-facing docs so the repo advertises the live release candidate instead of the beta snapshot.
- Shifted roadmap and release wording from "RC is next" to "stable validation is active."

---

## [2026-04-23] - v2.1.0-rc.1 Release Gate

### Changed

- Defined the explicit `v2.1.0-rc.1` smoke matrix for `release/v2`, including build, tests, race detection, benchmarks, example run targets, and curriculum validation.
- Tightened maintainer release guidance so the RC tag is only cut after the release-prep PR is merged, GitHub checks are green, and `release-blocker` issues are closed.

---

## [2026-04-22] - v2.1.0-beta.1 Beta-Complete Snapshot

### Added

- Published the `v2.1.0-beta.1` prerelease and public announcement as the beta-complete checkpoint for the v2.1 curriculum.
- Promoted `release/v2` into the active RC stabilization line for the next hardening phase.

### Changed

- Completed the public 12-section learner-path migration across root stage folders, learner-facing docs, and `curriculum.v2.json`.
- Tightened the single Go validator so release-facing docs, curriculum metadata, and repo health checks reflect the same source of truth more honestly.
- Aligned public docs and stage navigation with the current root-stage architecture, including the promoted backend, concurrency, quality, architecture, production, and flagship surfaces.
- Cleaned release-facing documentation so the beta-complete snapshot and RC branch model are explicit.

### Fixed

- Rewrote stale learner-facing links that still pointed to intentionally deleted `docs/stages/...` paths.
- Resolved Stage 06 wording drift so the README matches the promoted `HS`, `API`, and `DB` metadata path.
- Cleaned visible mojibake and release-state drift from the public docs used for learner orientation.

---

## [2026-04-18] - The v2.1 12-Section Architecture Optimization

### Changed

- **Curriculum Architecture Consolidation:** Optimized the drafted 21-section blueprint into a highly focused **12-Section (s00-s11)** model to reduce cognitive overhead and improve the learning progression.
- **Documentation Alignment:** Achieved 100% alignment across all core documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CODE-STANDARDS.md`, `COMMON-MISTAKES.md`) and satellite documentation (`README.md`, `LEARNING-PATH.md`, `CURRICULUM-BLUEPRINT.md`, `TESTING-STANDARDS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MAINTAINER-CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/PROGRESSION.md`).
- **Teaching Contract:** Formalized the `README`-first, `main.go`-second pedagogical contract. Every lesson now strictly requires Mission, Prerequisites, Mental Model, Visual Model, Machine View, Try It, In Production, and Thinking Questions.
- **AI Automation Skills:** Rewrote internal AI skills (`github-workflow` and `migration`) to strictly enforce the v2.1 12-section GitHub workflow and template requirements.
- **Next Up Navigation:** Upgraded terminal footers to output natively clickable paths (for example, `Run: go run ./01-getting-started/2-hello-world`) for seamless navigation in VS Code and modern terminals.

### Removed

- **Redundant Scripts:** Cleaned out the `scripts/` directory by deleting duplicated Python, PowerShell, and Shell issue automation scripts, centralizing all GitHub maintainer automation exclusively within `maintainer-scripts/`.

---

## [2026-04-17] - V2 Documentation Polish & Blueprint Eradication

### Added

- **Strict GitHub Workflow:** Officially documented and enforced the Antigravity `github-workflow` skill across `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `MAINTAINER-CHECKLIST.md`. All future changes now require approved issues linked to the v2 project board before drafting PRs.

### Changed

- **Curriculum Architecture Shift:** Fully transitioned all repository documentation from the legacy 11-stage model to the new **5-Phase, 21-Section Blueprint**.
- **Code Standards:** Added formal guidelines for the v2 three-tier Error Framework (`UserError`, `SystemError`, `FatalError`), context propagation, generics, and security practices.
- **Testing Standards:** Updated the coverage matrix to map against the 21 sections and explicitly added required fuzz testing and API/gRPC testing standards.
- **Reference Remapping:** Remapped all "Common Mistakes" cross-references to point to the correct sections in the new 21-section blueprint.

### Removed

- Purged the legacy `docs/stages/` and `docs/curriculum/` directories containing obsolete 11-stage and 15-chapter routing metadata.
- Deleted `beta-public-architecture.md`, `release-notes-v2-beta.md`, and obsolete cleanup scripts.

---

## [2026-04-07] - Public v2 Planning Kickoff

### Added

- Created the public `planning/v2` branch for the v2 Bible, migration planning, and structural prototype specs.
- Opened the first public v2 planning and prototype issues (#79-#88).
- Created the public v2 GitHub Project for planning and execution tracking.

### Changed

- Updated learner-facing docs to explain the v1/v2 transition more clearly.
- Clarified that `release/v1` remains the stable learner path while v2 is designed and rolled out incrementally.

---

## [2026-04-06] - Long-Lived v1/v2 Branch Workflow

### Changed

- Adopted `main` as the active v2 development branch and `release/v1` as the stable v1 maintenance line.
- Replaced the branch-per-release guidance in the contributor and release docs with a long-lived support branch model.
- Documented squash-merge for pull requests and `git cherry-pick -x` for fixes that must ship in both supported lines.
- Updated the PR template so contributors target `main` by default and call out v1 backports explicitly.

---

## [2026-04-06] - Curriculum Dependency Integration

### Added

- **Curriculum Dependency Graph:** Automated granular mapping of 15 sections across 28 sub-graphs using `curriculum.json`.
- **Premium Console Footers:** Integrated "Next Up" context-aware navigation footers into all 115 `main.go` files.
- **Visual Breadcrumbs:** Added previous/next/exercise navigation links to all section READMEs.
- **Root Metadata:** Updated root `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` with the new ID-based learning path (`GS`, `LB`, `CF`, and related section IDs).
- **Validation Script:** Created `scripts/validate_curriculum.go` to ensure filesystem integrity for all future additions.

### Fixed

- **ID Collision:** Resolved ID collisions for "Graceful Shutdown" vs "Getting Started" by implementing section-specific context namespaces.
- **Bulk Refactor Cleanup:** Fixed widespread Go syntax errors and markdown lint issues introduced during the integration phase.
- **[BUG] Chapter 1 Lesson 1:** Added missing instructions to `1-installation` (`GS.1`) boilerplate (#4).

---

## [2026-04-05] - The v1.0 Curriculum Migration

### Changed

- **Curriculum Architecture:** Completely refactored the legacy 28 flat-folder structure into an elite, chronologically ordered 15-chapter book format.
- **Cross-Domain Separation:** Decoupled concepts by their primary domain, cleanly separating runtime operations (`11-concurrency/time-and-scheduling`) and external operations (`09-io-and-cli/encoding`).
- **HTTP Domain Split:** Amputated the HTTP clients/mocking directory exactly down the middle, separating true HTTP networking (`10-web-and-database/http-client`) from test abstraction limits (`13-quality-and-performance/http-client-testing`).
- **Internal Imports:** Ran a mass-migration script converting all legacy `internal/` pointers uniformly.
- **Docs Update:** Rewrote README tables, ROADMAP tracking lists, and CONTRIBUTING guides to reflect the elite `v1` path routing.

### Removed

- Deleted the legacy compatibility symlinks from the repository root entirely.
