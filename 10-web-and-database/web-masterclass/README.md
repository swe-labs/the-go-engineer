# Section 13: Web Development Masterclass

## Learning Objectives

This is the **capstone section** — it ties together every concept from earlier sections into a real web application.

By the end, you will understand:
- HTTP routing with `net/http` and Go 1.22+ method-based patterns
- Dependency injection via the `application` struct
- HTML template rendering with caching and layouts
- Middleware pattern (`func(http.Handler) http.Handler`)
- Session management and flash messages
- Authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Form processing and server-side validation
- Repository pattern for database abstraction
- Pagination computation and API response structure
- Nested comment systems

## Contents

| Directory | Topic | Lectures | Level |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| `1-routing/` | HTTP routing, handlers, path params | 1-2 | Intermediate |
| `2-dependency-injection/` | App struct, slog, handler methods | 3-4 | Intermediate |
| `3-templates/` | html/template, caching, layouts, CSS | 5-7 | Intermediate |
| `4-middleware/` | Security headers, logging, panic recovery | 9 | Advanced |
| `5-sessions/` | Cookie sessions, flash messages | 10 | Advanced |
| `6-auth/` | bcrypt, login, registration, auth middleware | 11, 17-19 | Advanced |
| `7-forms/` | Form validation library, error handling | 12-16 | Advanced |
| `8-posts-crud/` | Repository pattern, SQLite, CRUD operations | 23-30 | Advanced |
| `9-pagination/` | Metadata computation, dynamic links | 25, 34, 38 | Advanced |
| `10-comments/` | Nested comments, thread-safe store | 28, 36-37 | Advanced |
| `11-full-app/` | **Capstone** — complete production-ready app | All | Advanced |

## How to Run

Each sub-directory is a standalone, runnable example:

```bash
# Run individual topics
go run ./13-web-masterclass/1-routing
go run ./13-web-masterclass/4-middleware
go run ./13-web-masterclass/8-posts-crud

# Run the full capstone app
go run ./13-web-masterclass/11-full-app

# Test endpoints with curl
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl -X POST -d '{"email":"test@go.dev","password":"password123"}' http://localhost:8080/register
curl -X POST -d '{"email":"test@go.dev","password":"password123"}' http://localhost:8080/login
```

## Architecture

```
Request → secureHeaders → logRequest → recoverPanic → Router → Handler
                                                          ↓
                                                   Repository Interface
                                                          ↓
                                                    SQLite Database
```

## Recommended Study Order

1. Start with `1-routing/` to understand HTTP basics
2. Move to `2-dependency-injection/` to learn the app struct pattern
3. Study `4-middleware/` — the most important pattern for production apps
4. Explore `6-auth/` for security fundamentals
5. Finish with `11-full-app/` to see everything wired together
