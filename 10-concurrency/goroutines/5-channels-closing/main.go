// ============================================================================
// Section 11: Concurrency - Closing Channels
// Level: Intermediate
// ============================================================================
//
// WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
//   - Why and when to close channels
//   - The comma-ok pattern: value, ok := <-ch (detecting closed channels)
//   - range over channels: automatically stops when the channel closes
//   - Rules: only the sender should close, never the receiver
//   - What happens when you read from or write to a closed channel
//   - Closing as a broadcast signal for multiple goroutines
//
// ANALOGY:
//   A channel is like a conveyor belt in a factory.
//   close(ch) is like hitting the STOP button on the belt.
//   Workers downstream see the belt stop and know no more items are coming.
//
// CRITICAL RULES:
//   1. Only the sender should close the channel
//   2. Sending to a closed channel causes a panic
//   3. Receiving from a closed channel returns zero values immediately
//   4. Closing is optional unless receivers must know "we are done"
//   5. Closing a nil channel causes a panic
//
// RUN: go run ./10-concurrency/goroutines/5-channels-closing
// ============================================================================
