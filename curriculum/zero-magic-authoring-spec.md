## Purpose

Every lesson must eliminate "magic" — concepts that learners can use but cannot explain
mechanically. This spec defines the pedagogical contract for all curriculum content.

## Core Principle

A learner should never write code they cannot explain step by step.

If a learner can complete an exercise but cannot describe *what happens in memory*,
*what happens over time*, or *what happens on failure*, the lesson has failed.

---

## Pedagogical Contract

Every lesson MUST contain these fields in its `zero_magic` block:

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `problem_solved` | string | What specific confusion or gap does this lesson eliminate? |
| `why_it_exists` | string | Why does this concept exist in Go/the system? |
| `mental_model` | string | A durable analogy or mental model |
| `under_the_hood` | string | Mechanical explanation of what happens at runtime |
| `step_by_step_execution` | array[string] | Ordered sequence of events during execution (prose format) |
| `hidden_magic_checks` | array[string] | Checks that prevent magic-reliant explanations |
| `failure_modes` | array[string] | What breaks and how it fails |
| `beginner_mistakes` | array[string] | Common mistakes with mechanical root cause |
| `proof_of_understanding` | string | How the learner proves mastery |

### Recommended Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `execution_timeline` | array[string] | Time-ordered event chain with `→` prefix (for I/O, concurrency, request handling) |
| `memory_timeline` | array[string] | Memory-ordered event chain with `→` prefix (for memory layout, allocation, pointer mechanics) |

| `production_examples` | array[string] | Real production code patterns |
| `performance_implications` | array[string] | Performance characteristics and tradeoffs |
| `operational_considerations` | array[string] | Production operations impact |
| `code_reading_tasks` | array[string] | Exercises in reading existing code |
| `refactoring_tasks` | array[string] | Exercises in improving existing code |
| `review_questions` | array[string] | Questions that test mechanical understanding |

## Explanation Philosophy

### 1. Execution Timeline Explanations

Do NOT only explain *what* a concept is.

Explain *exactly what happens over time*.

**Bad**: "Context cancellation stops goroutines."

**Good**:
```
request arrives
→ handler creates context.WithTimeout
→ DB query starts with context
→ client disconnects
→ context canceled
→ done channel closes
→ query goroutine receives cancellation
→ cleanup executes
→ goroutine exits
→ handler returns
```

### 2. Memory Timeline Explanations

For memory-related concepts, explain *exactly what happens in memory over time*.

**Bad**: "Slices share the underlying array."

**Good**:
```
slice header copied to function
→ len=3 cap=5, both point to same array
→ append called, len becomes 4
→ still within cap, no new allocation
→ different goroutine appends, exceeds cap
→ new array allocated, references diverge
```

### 3. Failure Mode Explanations

Every production concept must answer: "What breaks and how?"

Each failure mode should describe:
- The trigger condition
- The observable symptom
- The mechanical root cause
- The detection strategy (e.g., which metric, log line, or profile artifact reveals this failure)

### 4. Magic Elimination

A lesson contains "magic" if a learner can:
- Use the concept correctly
- But cannot explain the runtime mechanics

Eliminate magic by requiring learners to:
- Draw memory diagrams
- Trace execution timelines
- Walk through failure scenarios
- Read and explain source code before writing it

## Quality Rubric

Every lesson is reviewed against the dimensions in `quality-rubric.md`.

Minimum scores for golden lessons: 4/5 per dimension, 45/50 overall.

---

## Execution Timeline Standard

Every lesson involving **request handling, concurrency, or I/O** MUST include an
`execution_timeline` in the following `→`-prefixed format:

```
start condition
→ step 1: what happens
→ step 2: what happens next
→ step 3: branching point
  → path A: what happens
  → path B: what happens
→ step 4: resolution
→ end condition
```

**Format compliance:** The `→ ` prefix (U+2192 + space) at the start of each step
is the minimum requirement. Explicit "step N:" numbering is optional.
`execution_timeline` differs from `step_by_step_execution` in format (arrow-prefixed)
and in scope (focused on cross-cutting event chains like request lifecycle,
connection pooling, or goroutine scheduling).

**Trigger table:**

| Lesson Topic | Must have `execution_timeline`? |
|---|---|
| HTTP request handling (handler, middleware, parsing) | Yes |
| Concurrency (goroutines, channels, select) | Yes |
| I/O (database, network, filesystem) | Yes |
| Data structures (slices, maps, interfaces) | Optional — `step_by_step_execution` suffices |
| Error handling, panics, defer | Optional — `step_by_step_execution` suffices |

---

## Memory Timeline Standard

Every lesson whose primary learning objective involves **how values are laid out in
memory, how memory is allocated/freed, or how pointers/references affect state**
MUST include a `memory_timeline` showing state changes over time.

Format:

```
initial state: [variable] → [memory description]
→ operation 1: [change description]
→ operation 2: [change description]
→ final state: [variable] → [memory description]
```

**Trigger table:**

| Lesson Topic | Must have `memory_timeline`? |
|---|---|
| Slice internals (len/cap, sharing, aliasing) | Yes |
| Pointer and value mutation behavior | Yes |
| Escape analysis (stack vs heap decisions) | Yes |
| Goroutines (stack allocation, growth) | Yes |
| Goroutine leaks (cumulative memory consumption) | Yes |
| Interface representation (two-word itable) | Yes |
| defer/panic runtime data structures | Recommended |
| Channel internals (hchan struct) | Recommended |
| Connection pools, transaction pinning | Optional |
| Errors as values (interface wrapping) | Optional |

---

## Timeline Format Compliance

Both `execution_timeline` and `memory_timeline` MUST use the `→` (U+2192) prefix
for each step. Acceptable variations:

```
→ step description
→ step description: detail
  → sub-step description
initial state: description
```

Do NOT use markdown lists (`-`, `*`, `1.`) or code fences inside individual steps.
Each step is a plain string in a JSON array; the `→` prefix is the visual indicator.

---

## Validator Integration

The curriculum tool checks golden lessons via `validate-zero-magic` for:
- All 9 required fields present
- No placeholder content (detected by phrase matching)
- Mental model and under_the_hood quality (non-generic)

Priority-ordered roadmap for additional validators:

1. **Memory timeline validator** — flag golden lessons with topics from the
   Memory Timeline Standard trigger table if `memory_timeline` is absent
2. **Execution timeline validator** — flag golden lessons with topics from the
   Execution Timeline Standard trigger table if `execution_timeline` is absent
3. **Failure mode completeness** — verify each failure mode describes trigger +
   symptom + root cause + detection strategy
4. **Beginner mistake root-cause quality** — verify each mistake explains the
   mechanical root cause, not just the surface behavior
5. **Timeline format validator** — verify `execution_timeline` and `memory_timeline`
   entries use the correct `→` prefix format
